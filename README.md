The current project teaches me the fundamentals of HTML and
combines all the learned elements from the previous lessons.

I had to make a basic HTML website, 
showingcasing recipes for different kinds of food.
Using free images for the 3 recipes and
also using ordered and unordered lists,
for the ingredients and each steps needed.
Creating a new repository on Github and
cloning the SSH key via git clone.

Now the only thing left to do is to
commit my changes to Github.
